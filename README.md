# Livescore

This is a **React + TailwindCSS + NextUi** application that displays the score of the matches of over 200 championships made for the only purpose of learning.
The whole application is written with **Typescript**, it also includes **routing**, **contexts**,**reducers** etc.

I'm using a Livescore Api created by Api Dojo, here is the link **https://rapidapi.com/apidojo/api/livescore6**

## Running the project

To run the project you have to execute the following commands:

Steps to run the application:

-   Clone the project
-   Go to this [Rapid Api page](https://rapidapi.com/apidojo/api/livescore6) and subscribe, you'll obtain the **Key** and **Host (link)**
-   Rename the **env.example** file to **.env** and insert the two strings after the equal signs
-   Execute `$ npm install` to install the dependencies
-   Execute `$ npm run dev` to start the application
-   Go to **http://localhost:5173** and if you see the application running, you've followed the steps correctly

### Note:

This application is still in **alpha phase** so there aren't many functionalities such as statistics, goals or assists for a match but those will hopefully be implemented in a new release.

Hope you enjoy
