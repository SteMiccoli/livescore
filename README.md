# Livescore

This is a **React + TailwindCSS + NextUi** application that displays the score of the matches of over 200 championships made for the only purpose of learning.
The whole application is written with **Typescript**, it also includes **routing**, **contexts**,**reducers** etc.

I'm using a Livescore Api created by Api Dojo, here is the link **https://rapidapi.com/apidojo/api/livescore6**

### Note:

This application is still in **alpha phase** so there aren't many functionalities such as statistics, goals or assists for a match but those will hopefully be implemented in a new release.

Hope you enjoy
